## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **State Management**: Zustand
- **Canvas**: HTML5 Canvas API
- **Real-time**: Supabase Realtime (Phase 2)
- **Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (Phase 4)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- For real-time features (Phase 2+): Supabase account

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd collaborative-whiteboard
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser

### Usage

1. Click "Create New Room" on the home page
2. Start drawing on the canvas
3. Share the room link with others (real-time features coming in Phase 2)

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl+Z` / `Cmd+Z` - Undo
- `Ctrl+Y` / `Cmd+Y` - Redo
- `Ctrl+Shift+Z` / `Cmd+Shift+Z` - Redo
- `Delete` / `Backspace` - Delete selected element
- `Enter` - Confirm text input
- `Escape` - Cancel text input

## Development Roadmap

- [x] **Phase 1**: Single-user canvas with drawing tools
- [x] **Phase 2**: Real-time collaboration with Supabase (code complete, needs config)
- [x] **Phase 3**: Cursor sharing and UX improvements
- [x] **Phase 4**: Export, dark mode, and polish
- [x] **Phase 5**: Advanced drawing tools (shapes, text, selection)
- [ ] **Phase 6**: Pan/zoom, layers, and advanced features (optional)

## Quick Start

### Without Supabase (Local Mode)
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```
Open http://localhost:3001 - All drawing features work locally!

### With Supabase (Full Real-time)
1. Follow [REALTIME_SETUP.md](./REALTIME_SETUP.md) to configure Supabase
2. Add credentials to `.env.local`
3. Restart dev server
4. Open same room in multiple windows to see real-time collaboration!

## Architecture Highlights

### Drawing Engine
- Custom HTML5 Canvas implementation for optimal performance
- Quadratic curve smoothing for natural-looking strokes
- Device pixel ratio support for sharp rendering on high-DPI displays
- Layered rendering approach for future optimization

### State Management
- Zustand for lightweight, efficient state management
- Immutable stroke history for undo/redo
- Optimistic updates for immediate feedback

### Performance
- requestAnimationFrame for smooth 60fps rendering
- Event throttling for cursor movements (Phase 3)
- Efficient stroke batching for network transmission (Phase 2)
